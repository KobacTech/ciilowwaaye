			<h1 class="test">Howlwadaag</h1>
			<p>In the modified CSS code, the .banner class is set to position: relative, and the .test class is positioned absolutely with top: 50% and left: 50%. The transform property is used to center the text both vertically and horizontally within the .banner div.
			In the example above, the text-align: justify; rule is used to justify the text within the paragraph. Additionally, the text-align-last: center; rule is applied to center the last line of the paragraph when it is shorter than the full width.

With this CSS code, the paragraph will be justified with all lines except the last one, which will be centered if it is shorter than the full width.

Here's an updated version of the HTML code with the CSS included:
